# Rep√©ir

This is my entry for the Global Game Jam 2020, with the theme REPAIR.
it is a point and click puzzle game, that explores the meanings of the word repair.
Made by a sole developer, the game has the duration of 20 seconds, black and white vector graphics and simple interactions.
It's all made in JavaScript using the p5.js Library.

## How to use

Because of the nature of web browser (security), to play the game localy you will need to setup a web server.
With that aside, download the files, open the *index.html* with you browser of preference and you are good to go.

## Build with

[P5.js](https://p5js.org/) - JavaScript library.
